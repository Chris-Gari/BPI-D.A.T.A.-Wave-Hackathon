	abstract = {MSMEs are an important sector of the Philippine economy as they play a vital role in the county’s economic development, yet many of these struggle to thrive. An important question remains as to the factors that influence MSMEs’ success and failure. This study adopts the PESTLE framework to identify factors that positively and negatively affects MSMEs. Using a qualitative focus group discussion, this paper finds that social, technological, and economic factors play an important role with regards to MSME owners’ experience with business. Technological and social factors were cited as significant positive contributors, while economic factors were mentioned as negative contributors to MSME success. These findings describe the complex nature of doing business in the Philippines for the MSME sector.},
